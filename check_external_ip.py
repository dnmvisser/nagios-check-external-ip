     description='Checks the external IP dynamically assigned by the service provider.',
     epilog="""This plugin is designed for those who need to know the IP address dynamically 
            assigned to them by their service provider. The plugin checks with an external 
            website to find out what public IP address has been assigned by the service 
            providers. The results of the check are stored in a temp file.
            If the results from the current IP check differs from the pervious results an 
            alert is triggered. These alerts contain the current IP address assigned. 

            This plugin doesn't require any arguments, and will work for both IPv4 and IPv6 
            address assignments. However if you have a dual stack network connection you can
            test either the IPv4 address or the IPv6 independently using the appropriate flag
            It is recommended that the max check attempts be set to 1 for this service check. 
            Failure to do will result in missed alerts when a new IP address is assigned.
